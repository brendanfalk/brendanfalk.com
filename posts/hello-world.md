# Hello World

Welcome to my new blog! I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences here.

This is a simple, minimalist blog built with **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **TypeScript**. The design is inspired by clean, readable interfaces that focus on content.

## Why I Started This Blog

I wanted a simple place to share my thoughts, experiences, and learnings. The web is full of complex platforms, but sometimes you just need something simple and personal.

## What You Can Expect

- Technical insights and tutorials
- Personal reflections and thoughts
- Updates on projects I'm working on

Thanks for reading, and I hope you find something interesting here!
