### Startup Fundraising Modelling



Two levers you can pull to own more of your company and get a higher share price: 

* Increase valuation
* Decrease number of shares valuation is based on 



Golden rule: For a given valuation, how is the total number of shares being calculated?





What is the toal "fully diluted capitalization"



### Post-Money SAFE conversion

* Think of your SAFE as a percentage e.g. if I did a SAFE of $10k on a 10M cap, that equals 0.1%
  * Okay, but 0.1% of what number of shares?
* Total number of shares: Sum up all of your founder shares + stock option pool shares (allocated and unallocated) + all shares being issued by the SAFE, and the SAFE holder will own that % of the shares





Another way of thinking about a post-money SAFE:

Raising $100k at 15M cap is that same as saying: "I will give you 100k in exchange for 0.67% (100k/15M) of all shares in your company. I consider the total number of shares in your company to include all other SAFEs after they've converted  + your total number of issued shares to founders + the total shares in your stock option plan before your Series A"





Giving out option grants

Takes into account all shares (based on )





### Series A

* Valuation can be based on total number of shares of: all founder shares + all option pool shares (from your first option pool, allocated and unallocated) + all shares of SAFE converted **+ often has an embedded stock option pool**
  * This is a pre-money stock option pool and it's bad





If an investor say 20M on 100M post money they are doing 80M pre-money. 

To get the value per share, you take $80m and divide by total number of shares as above (founder shares, allocated option pool shares from first)



Pro rata

* Straight after the series A financing occurs, anyone with pro-rata is entitled to buy up to their amount of shares that would make them keep the same equity percentage (if everyone did this, the total number of shares sold would be more)
* This will dilute the series A investor
