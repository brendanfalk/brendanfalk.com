### Paying US tax as an international founder

I am the founder of a venture backed ([Fig](https://fig.io)) startup in the US. I am from Australia and am not a US-citizen. I recently graduated from Harvard and am still on my F-1 student visa. Needless to say, my tax situation is annoyingly complicated. Then again, all US tax is annoyingly complicated. 

The below are notes for myself which I also hope will prove to be useful for others in a similar situation to me. I am obviously not a lawyer or an accountant

### Summary
* If you graduated last calendar year, you are probabably a resident for tax purposes. If not, you can choose to be a resident or a non-resident
* If you choose to be a resident for tax purposes, use TurboTax. If not, use Sprintax or an accountant.
* If you're not ready by April 15th, file an extension (form 4848)
* Even if you use TurboTax, you may have to manually file some forms e.g. FinCEN Form 114 (FBAR)
