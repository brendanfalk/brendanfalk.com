Formula for



As CEO of [Fig](https:://fig.io) this is the email I would want to receive.

1. This strategy is how I 
2. I am a tech CEO and this is the email I would want to receive
3. People respond to me ()



**One other thing**
* Less is more
* Assume the CEO is the busiest person in the world. Tim Cook gets 800 emails a day. Your first challenge is to get TC to read your email. Second challenge is to get him to action it
* Let someone action your email in 15 seconds. Two possible actions
  * "I'd love to chat, grab a time on my calendly"
  * They forward to a hiring manager
If you're emailing a CEO of a company with 20+ people, chances are you want the hiring manager. If you're emailing a CEO of a smaller company, chances are the CEO / CTO will take the call.


* If you're not going to get the job, you're screwed anyway




Why is this good?
1. It's short. Everyone is busy. CEOs are incredibly busy. As soon as they see a wall of text, they archive the email. 
2. Bottom line up front. You straight up say you want a job. Most people treat emails like a mathematical proof. The reader needs to decipher everything to get there. That's stupid. 
3. F-pattern of reading - gets progressi
4. 




5. keep you email less than 120 words (seriously, no more than 120 words, i promise you)
6. start with a one sentence intro about you
7. Say you came across company, you are. a big fan, and you would love to intern there for the summer
8. have 3 very short bullet points that sell you
9. Talk about specific things you would like to work on 
10. Say you're looking forward to hearing from them
11. Attach your resume
12. Follow up 5 days later if you haven't heard from them
13. Follow up another 5 days later if you haven't heard




Note, all of this advice also applies for emailing the CTO too and honestly pretty much any position...
