# Understanding Employee Equity



Why is this so complicated? The IRS.

Is it actually that complicated? No it's just a bunch of definitions you have to learn. Just memorise the definition of ~20 terms and you'll be fluent.



Who is this guide most useful to:

1. Employees at US based tech startups trying to understand how what equity are start up is / has offered them and how to minimise tax
2. Founders of US based tech startups trying to decide how to give equity to their employees



## Most common scenario

The value of common stock is higher than the value of your stock option exercise price or stock unit price

Notes:

* Long term capital gains tax probably has a lower rate than your income tax rate
* To get the long term capital gains rate with ISOs, the sale of your ISO has to be a "qualifying disposition". There are a few more rules (you very likely will not need them), but if you are intersted in, you can read them [here](https://www.nceo.org/articles/stock-options-restricted-phantom-sars-espps)
* Remember, *exercising* a stock option means you now own the share. It does *not* necessariy mean you can immediately sell that share. So you could be liable to pay tax even though you haven't exercise an option!

* The shares you received were probably restricted stock awards (RSAs) and you immediately did an 83(b) election

## When can I sell?

* Public Listing:
  * IPO - Only 180 days after 
  * SPAC - ???
  * Direct Listing - 
* Startup is acquired
* Private investors
  * Fundraising events: Founders and sometimes very early employees can sell during private fundraising events (like Series B, Series C)
  * Secondary Markets (e.g. Carta X, Equity Zen...): You can list your shares there only if your company allows this



Other than being acquired, you don't have to sell when any of these events happen, you can choose to hold onto stock for as long as possible. 



## IPO or Startup Acquired

You're fine. No matter what you have above, ?you're chilling?



An IPO just gives you an opportunity to sell. Same with an acquisition. You can hang on if you'd like! Founders and early employees also often have opportunities 



Only thing to be aware of here: 

* If there is an IPO you cannot sell on the day of the IPO. You have to wait 180 days 

### 



## Startup's price decreases

e.g. the current common stock price is less than your stock option exercise price or RSU price



If you own

* Stock Options: you're fucked

* RSUs: not sure

### Other Terminology

| Term                            | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Preferred Shares                |                                                              |
| Common Stock                    |                                                              |
| Vesting                         |                                                              |
| Cliff                           |                                                              |
| 83(b)                           | The 83(b) election is a document notifying the IRS that someone has early exercised and that the difference between their exercise price and the FMV is zero, and therefore they do not owe any taxes on the transaction. It is only for ISOs |
|                                 |                                                              |
| Stock Options                   | The ability (but are not required) to buy a share in the future at a fixed price. Think of it as a piece of paper NOT a share.  Fast forward to the future, if the current share price is greater than the fixed price on your option, you can buy it and sell and the difference is your profit! |
| Exercise / Strike / Grant Price | The price you can pay to convert a stock option (your piece of paper) to a share. It is almost always the "fair market value" price of stock at the time the share is issued |
| 409(a)                          |                                                              |
| FMV                             |                                                              |
| AMT                             |                                                              |
| Restricted Stock Units          | The right to receive shares (for free or at a fixed price) in the future once certain requirements are met (e.g. working a certain number of years or hitting a performance target). |
